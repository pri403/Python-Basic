        "Q1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility.\n",
        "  It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages worldwide.\n",
        "  It is popular because:\n",
        "  1. Easy to learn\n",
        "  2. Versatile\n",
        "  3. Object-Oriented\n",
        "  4. Dynamic typing\n",
        "  5. Interpreted Language\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "- An interpreter in Python is a special program that executes Python code line by line instead of compiling the whole program at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, pre-defined keywords are special reserved words that have fixed meanings and are used to define the rules and structure of\n",
        "  the language. They cannot be used as variable names, function names, or identifiers. For example, if, else, and while are used for\n",
        "  control flow, def is used to define a function, and class is used to define a class. Keywords are case-sensitive, so True is valid\n",
        "  but true is not.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "- No , keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python because they are reserved words that already have a special meaning in the language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "- Mutability refers to whether the value of an object can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "  If an object can be modified, it is called mutable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "- Lists are designed to store collections of data that may need to change.\n",
        "  You can add, remove, or update elements without creating a new list.\n",
        "  Internally, lists allocate extra memory to allow modifications.\n",
        "- Tuples are meant to store fixed data that should not change.\n",
        "  Once created, their elements cannot be altered, added, or removed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "- == Operator (Equality)\n",
        " Checks if values are the same.\n",
        " Compares the contents of two objects.\n",
        "- is Operator (Identity)\n",
        "  Checks if two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "  Compares the identity (memory address) of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "- In Python, logical operators are used to combine or modify conditional expressions and return a Boolean value (True or False).\n",
        "  There are three logical operators:\n",
        "  and → Returns True only if both conditions are true.\n",
        "  or → Returns True if at least one condition is true.\n",
        "  not → Reverses the result, making True into False and False into True.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "- Type casting in Python is the process of converting one data type into another. It can be of two types:\n",
        "  Implicit Type Casting – Performed automatically by Python when it converts a smaller data type into a larger one to prevent data loss.\n",
        "  Explicit Type Casting – Performed manually by the programmer using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "- Difference between Implicit and Explicit Type Casting (Theory)\n",
        "  Implicit Type Casting: Also called type conversion, it is done automatically by Python. The interpreter converts one data type into\n",
        "  another without user involvement, usually from a smaller to a larger data type to avoid data loss.\n",
        "  Explicit Type Casting: Also called type casting, it is done manually by the programmer using built-in functions like int(), float(),\n",
        "  str(), etc., to convert one data type into another.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "- The purpose of **conditional statements in Python** is to make decisions in a program by executing certain blocks of code only when\n",
        "  specific conditions are true. They allow the program to follow different paths based on given conditions, making it dynamic and logical.\n",
        "  For example, using `if`, `elif`, and `else`, a program can check conditions and run the appropriate code accordingly. In short, conditional\n",
        "  statements control the **flow of execution** based on conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "- The elif statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions in a sequence. It stands for “else if” and comes after an if statement.\n",
        "  When the if condition is false, Python checks the elif condition; if that is true, the corresponding block of code is executed. You can use\n",
        "  multiple elif statements to test different conditions, but only the first True condition will run, and the rest are skipped. If none of the\n",
        "  if or elif conditions are true, the else block (if provided) will execute.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "- For Loop: Used when the number of iterations is known or when iterating over a sequence (like list, string, or range). It automatically goes\n",
        "  through each element or value in the sequence.\n",
        "  While Loop: Used when the number of iterations is not known in advance. It keeps running as long as the given condition remains true.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "- A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance and the loop needs to continue until a certain condition becomes false.\n",
        "Example Scenario: Suppose you are writing a program to keep asking a user for their password until they enter the correct one. Here, you don’t know how many attempts the user will take, so a while loop is appropriate.\n",
        "A while loop is best when repetition depends on a condition being met rather than a fixed number of iterations."
